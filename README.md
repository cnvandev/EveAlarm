#The "Eve" Alarm Clock#

This project is an alarm clock that tries to interact with you in order to wake you up. I've been having trouble waking up on time for *years*, and I know for a fact talking to someone helps. I'm hoping this will be a non-annoying prompt to wake up, maybe have it help by reading news or Twitter or Facebook, something like that.

I'll eventually branch off the Conversation stuff into its own library, for now I'm just getting it out there. This is an interesting problem and I want to come up with cool ways to solve it. I'm also open to suggestions for a different Text-To-Speech implementation - the default Android speech synthesizer is cool, but *damn* she is annoying.
